          <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6><p>

            It soon became clear that this was not going to be a simple redesign of a website, but so much more a tool to be
            used by an array of different parts of a large organization tasked with representing one of the largest industries in the United States; retail.

          </p>

          <p>

            With this project I wore more hats than just design. My hand touched the information architecture, content strategy, of course design, and taking
            over for a project manager in charge of all the existing content as well as new content, around a decades worth, making it to the new site.

          </p>



          <i><h6>The Process</h6></i>


          <p>

            I traveled to Washington D.C. with a few collegues to conduct stakeholder interviews with the client which kicked off our involvement with the project
            they needed accomplished.

          </p>
          <span class="subHead"><b>Content and Design Space</b></span>
          <p>

            Shortly thereafter, my digital trail of contribution started by undertaking an enormous content-audit which was more than
            just a long slog through a spreadsheet. It was vital in the effort to categorize and keep track of much existing content, as well as inform the new
            information architecture and design templates of a website which reached far beyond simple end-user content.
            <img src="img/NRF_Sitemap.png">


          </p>

          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Interaction Design</b></span>
          <p>

            Working closely with the team, I created these wireframes in our effort to come up with
            the templates that so much content and funtionality would be well fit. Starting with hand-drawn sketches
            of ideas for quick and light iteration, I then moved the ideas to this highly-annotated form to lead discussion with the client
            regarding our recommendation for how to present different content and functionality in different templates with one main breakpoint for responsive display.<br><br>

            <img src="img/NRF_Annotated_Wireframes.png"><br><br>

          </p>


          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Content Management</b></span>
          <p>

            Over the last 2 months of the project, I took over for one of the project managers who had been in charge of all the new site's content on our end. However, a situation arose and I had to step in and do
            about 4 months worth of work, which was neglected, within the remaining 2 months. This included making extensive use of the content management system we had set up, keeping track of old content that
            was to be imported into the new site, working with Quality Assurance to make sure content being imported was up to standards, as well as heading ad-hoc teams to accomplish
            this importation of content. This also included flying back to the client's offices in Washington D.C. for a week, working with their teams and our development team, and training
            their team on the CMS, so future involvement from me going forward with new content would not be necessary.



          </p>



          <i><h6>The Win</h6></i>
          <p>

            More than just a new skin on a website was made. A more engaging and usable experience for the end user and a more usefull
            collaboration platform for internal teams found positive impact on everything from analytics on news published on the site to
            changing some of the internal collaboration flows of the organization for the better.

      <div class="modal-body">

          <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6>


          <p>

            A large grocery store chain in Utah needed a new website. However, it wasn't just a simple web page redesign. What they needed was a way to
            create and manage highly dynamic content, manage their ecommerce offerings and connect it to their point of sale system, manage fulfilment and in-store capabilities,
            schedule and manage sessions of in-store cooking classes they run, and so on. This warranted a necessity to design and implement a custom content management system (CMS)
            to accomplish all this, since most out of the box solutions either did not support requisite functionality or required too much configuration and shoehorning of functionality to
            accomplish these requirements. Additionally, great effort had to be done in order to get the product delivered within a very quick turnaround of three months. Remarkable for a
            site of this size and complexity.


          </p>





          <h6><i><b>The Process</b></i></h6>

          <img src="img/harmons_sitemap.png">
          <br>
          <p>

            We started with a content audit and current sitemap in order to communicate with the marketing team at Harmons which content was going to be imported
            to the new site, what content was to be removed, as well as in what new information heirarchy it was to be presented.



          </p>

          <p>

            This project saw heavy silmultaneous inter-departmental collaboration and iteration from the beginning until the end. Design, reviews, updates and iteration included all parts of the team.
            Project management, the client's marketing team, user experience and visual designers, and developers. In a sense, two projects were taking place in tandem. Both the website as seen by end-users, and the
            CMS which was a custom solution which especially needed to be intuative and simple to use while affording control of some rather complicated things. Things such as front-end content
            publishing with start and end dates, order fulfilment which had to account for current oven space and availability, the creation of promo codes and limits on their usage,
            sales reporting, etc. The wireframes shown here represent part of my contribution to these efforts.<br><br>

            <img src="img/harmons_wireframes.png"><br><br>
            <img src="img/harmons_admin_wireframes.png"><br><br>

          </p>


          <h6><i><b>The Win</b></i></h6>
          <p>

            The right team made all the difference here. Along with the selection of the right technologies, quick exploration and iteration of improvements in a very agile way, and keeping documentation light,
            we were able to deliver a solution for the client which not only fulfiled the scoped purpose, but gave them so much more. They saw noticable increases in interaction with many of their offerings to their customers,
            such as cooking class enrolment,
            online order fulfilment, and social media interaction and other user-generated content. The positive impact was especially seen shortly after launch, since the reason there was such a quick deadline for turnaround was that they aimed to
            have the site launched in time for the thanksgiving and christmas holidays in the United States.

          <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6>
          <p>
            A sales team at Adobe needed a tool to use in the field to present data visualizations to many
          high-level clients. Visualizations which needed to be not just aesthetically pleasing but informative and
          easily manipulated in context of a sales presentation. Moreover, it needed to work responsively across
          various device platforms, be accurate and engaging to the end audience.

          <img src="img/fbaFlow1.jpg">

        </p>



          <h6><i><b>The Process</b></i></h6>
          <p>
            After a couple days of presenting and sketching at Adobe, we started on a really tough, complicated web app with lots of numbers interacting with databases with a very dynamic display.
            Initial iteration with flow charts I created to get the complicated process and business requirements down before hours were spent on
            design and development
          </p>

          <p>

            While working closely and constantly iterating with developers, the team and I designed and implemented what was contained in many complicated spreadsheets into an intuitive flow with user-interactable
            controls to both visualize and manipulate the data. I created the wireframes below to guide that discussion during that process. These wireframes were not
            just a deliverable lobbed over the fence to inform design; however, they were a storytelling piece used to aid communication. They were changed and iterated upon every step of the way
            well through design and into development.

          </p>


          <img src="img/fbaWire1.jpg"><br><br>

          <h6><i><b>The Win</b></i></h6>
          <p>

            The win here was successfully giving Adobe sales teams a portable and visually engaging app with which to show dynamic
            numbers and time data to potential customers. Giving them the level of control and specificity over the numbers and data while having
            the output remain presentable and digestible to the presentee.<br><br>

            The project was such a success, that after being presented internally at Adobe, we won a slough of subsequent projects implementing
            similar functionality for multiple additional departmens and needs at Adobe for this kind of thing.

      <div class="modal-body">

        <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6><p>

        This project was completed as a quarter-long project for the capstone course of a HCI course series at UCSD. We were to work very collaboratively
        on a project which gave us valuable experience in that it required us to form a plan and perform interviews, experiments, deign according to the
        User Centered Design process all while being required to interact with people outside the university. It afforded real-world experience.


        </p>





        <i><h6>The Process</h6></i>


        <p>

          In less than ten weeks, our group had interviewed, observed, and usability tested over thirty musicians in various contexts, created affinity diagram trees and dynamic models,
          developed a series of wireframes, and ultimately presented our findings to the class and professorship under professional scrutiny.

        </p>
        <span class="subHead"><b>Methodology</b></span>
        <p>

          Methodology was key. The majority of the design cycle was spent on user research, either in the field or in artificial laboratories.
          At first, we interviewed a wide range of musicians, from a solo pianist who distributes her own podcast to a jamband with
          less than three shows under their belt to professors exploring remote music collaboration themselves and other professionals, we decided to narrow our
          scope of design to simply a jamming VoIP application.

          While we continued to collect data about the actual interaction between people in an orchestrated context,
          we began seeking data regarding such via computer-mediated interaction, latency included. To accomplish this, we set up musicians in different
          soundproofed rooms and connected them via Skype to play a piece together.
          <img src="img/musStudy.jpg">


        </p>


        <p>

          After the data was collected, we would retreat to our brainstorm and begin diagramming what we saw.
           The team noted that latency was indeed the worst thing experienced by the musicians in tests, and the
           product was tweaked to accurately inform the user realistically how poor the latency is as well as override the
           issue with an artificial buffer.

          <img src="img/musWire.png"><br><br>

        </p>






        <i><h6>The Win</h6></i>
        <p>

          In this project, I not only learned more how to create affinity note diagrams, prioritize product
          features while neglect others, and coordinate an evolving project with a hard deadline, but put it all in practice in real-world contexts.
          Ultimately, detailed wireframes with data-driven features were developed for this hypothetical program.

          <h6><i>The Process</i></h6>
          The developers really take the prise and credit on this one; but UX and Design also had to work closely together with the devs even
          before code was written to present such a technologically tricky web app and how it would work across devices of all kinds of screen sizes and types.
          Early communication and iteration was paramount to the success of a product so time-consuming and costly regarding dev hours.<br><br>

          <h6><i>The Win</i></h6>

          the

          Such a diverse corporation, made up of so much more than just the beverage, needed a content strategy and messaging presentation
          to rein it all in. So many parts and considerations to blend it all together under one umbrella while keeping the parts distinct
          was a challenge while integrating a site with a robust CMS and all the trappings of day to day corporate needs. Everything of course responsive
          and not just viewable but useful across devices, screen sizes and platforms.<br><br>



          <img src="img/pcoWire2.jpg">

          <h6><i>The Process</i></h6>
          Started with an immense content audit with which we based our content migration, omission, and identification of new content needs and opportunities for templating.
          <br><br>

          This transitioned into the usual sketching, wireframing, click-throughs and client feedback. While it's easy to get into the rut of a corporate waterfall process, I kept
          it fresh and agile mainly through what a UX professional should be primarily concerned with anyway. Communication. While designing, I often
          did quick guerilla in-office paper tests with others on and off project, quick A/Bs online, and keeping developers and visual designers involved
          in my main steps well before they'd have otherwise been involved.<br><br>

          All the usual quick iteration with UX, vis Design and Dev with and without deliverables, but we felt it necessary to get into the

          really immerse ourselves into the TM culture. A number of us actually went and participated in a TM event to get our

                            The time is rapidly approaching! In just a few short months we will, under sponsorship via LifeNets, be going to Ukraine to serve
                            children in need.
                          </p>


                          <p>
                            It will be a quite a rewarding challenge, but I know you all will succeed in your efforts. Below is information regarding
                            The general plan as it develops. I will make updates to this site as information changes and specific plans come together.
                            Thank you for your willingness to serve toward such a worthwhile cause.

                                        Teaching some English and having a fun time is important, but what we are really
                                        here to do is to build relationships and provide a fun and engaging environment for
                                        some really sweet children who don't have it so easy at all. Many of them really look forward
                                        to this time all year, and the smiles you'll see on their faces when we arrive will make that apparent!

                                      <p>
                                        The lesson times outlined are for what we prepare, yet the playtimes are often where we can shine.
                                        Much of the English learning really takes place during these periods when they are clearly eager to
                                        ask questions and try out their engish. Encourage them and be engaged with them. It'll make
                                        for an experience both you and they will never forget.

                                            there are a few week-long goals which I hope to have the individual days'
                                            activities and lessons supplement and support.

                                Planning group lessons which give them some English words and phrases, but then lead into more hands-on
                                activities relevant to the earlier lesson. Those activities can be varied such as games, arts and crafts, sports.

                                They love singing songs, and those are great for teaching kids too.
                                They have a version of the hymn "as the deer" in Ukrainian which many will already know.

                                We should try to identify two other songs. Simple kids' religious songs have worked well in the past,
                                but I can ask my friends over there of any other hymns which we may know the English versions of already as well.

                                  This is also our opportunity when teaching the week-long song or psalm, to break the vocabulary down into these

                                    they will have Vasil Polichko give them a bible study, so we should try to keep this time activity-based.

                                    the same as the free for all, which is liable to ensue.

                                    It may be a good idea to break the group down into age ranges, but mostly I'm thinking we could be at specific stations
                                    where we have an activity each of us can own and rotate different groups of kids around.

                                      well in more standard Ukrainian and Russian as well.

                                      or even have skype sessions with you to learn a few things. If you'd rather learn some Ukrainian, Stephka and I (вітаю Стефка! як ти?)

                                      these links will take you to the free "lite" version, yay free, but I'd say the paid one is well worth it. It downloads to your phone and speaks at you,
                                      so you can use it to learn up as well as have it say things for you to the kids there.<br><br>

                                      There is a "Speak Easy Russian" application as well.

                                        If you'd like to have any teaching materials at the camp which consist of larger things like packs of balloons,
                                        games, arts and crafts type stuff, Oleh has offered to coordinate a shipping run no later than May 1st so we don't have to haul all kinds
                                        of heavy stuff in extra bags which are liable to get lost in all the airplane things. Let me know if you have any ideas of what
                                        you'd like sent over or to bring along with you, you can coordinate that through me.

                                        I'm planning on bringing certain things, and I will update the site here with a list as things come together, so you all know what we have and who may be bringing it.
